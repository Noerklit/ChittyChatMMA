## How to run ChittyChat
To run the server, navigate to the server folder. Then run the following command: go run server.go

To run a client, navigate to the client folder. Then run the following command: go run client.go
A client will be prompted to enter a name, before they can join the chat. Afterwards, they can simply type any messages they would like to broadcast to the chat

To get the message "Servermessage, 'User x' has left the chat" you need to run the client from a external terminal (not in vscode) and exit the terminal. It does not work with ctrl c.
